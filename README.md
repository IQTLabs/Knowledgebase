## Development practices

**Why are we doing this?**

*Implement reusable, well-written, organized projects based on open source best practices.*

* Reduces maintenance overhead by using common solutions for common problems (e.g. use the same testing framework).
* Increased agility by reducing ramp up time as staff are reassigned or new contractors are onboarded on projects (codebases are organized the same way, risk is lowered with test coverage)
* Increase ease of adoption by customers (codebase organized as much as possible to industry standards which will be familiar to customer peers)
* Increase impact of staff contributions beyond individual projects (framework contributions positively impact all projects)
* Don’t adopt practices that don’t make sense (e.g. don’t require 100% unit test coverage as the resource commitment/reward may not make sense).


We are attempting to catalog all of our preferred development tools and practices. We are always trying to stay current in our knowledge and improve when and where we can. If you have knowledge you want to contribute, please let us know or open a PR.
